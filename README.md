# Job Search AI Tool

## Introduction

Inspired by exhausting job search experience, I am motivated to develop a tool for automatic job qualification keyword extraction and customized cover letter generation. 
Considered the limited time and computing resources for this project, the project is not intended to achieve state-of-art level performance but to better understand GPT2 architecture by developing it from scratch and leverage pre-trained models by fine-tuning. 
The models are evaluated with classical metrics including F1 score and ROUGE. Future work will focus on GPT training techniques and scalable AI model deployment.
